# SolarWinds
Useful python scripts when interacting with SolarWinds as the inventory database for housing network device information. 

## Prerequisites

These scripts were written in Python3. Many of them rely on Paramiko and the Solarwinds modules. 

### Note

Many of these scripts can be written better. Many of these scripts do not follow good coding practices. This is because many of these were written in a rush with only the need to acheive network automation on the spot. Others were written when I was still a beginner in python (which I still very much am). I will develop these further as I find their use increases.

Use these at your own risk. I am not responsible for config losses or damage that may occur with the use of these scripts.
